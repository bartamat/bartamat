# Hi there 👋
### Something about me 👨‍🎓
- I am a junior developer for Apple platform, trying to learn everything there is. 
- Currently focusing on Swift and SwiftUI and as a result of SwiftUI youth I sometimes use tools from UIKit.
- I have also worked with frameworks like CoreData, Keychain, Firebase and few more.

### Where to contact me 📬
- developer@bartamatej.com

## Things I have created 🪜
### Kamasutra
- Project that was concerning something of a taboo topic, but I nontheless approached it with an open mind and did my best.
- I was tasked to update a 5 year old app that was written in Swift 3 and used JSON as data storage. To test my skills and ease my pain I have decided to recreate this app from the scratch.
- Frontend SwiftUI
- CoreData used to store larger amount of data. UserDefaults for saving current state. Keychain for storing user passcode.
- Local Authentication for Face/Touch-ID.
- Overall, since this is my latest creation I am happy with how it turned out.

### QuizIt
- This app was created as semestral project for a school subject. Idea was to generate quizzes for kids using Google AI/ML api. Quiz was created from pictures which have been used to generete answers. Quizzes could also be shared and rated among the users.
- Backend build on Firebase and its tools (authentication, storage, firestore, cloud functions).
- Combine and closures used for asynchronous data handling.
- Frontend SwiftUI with occasional UIKit.
- As this was my first non tutorial contact with iOS development, it turned out to be a bit more complicated than expected.
- Looking back I would have done plenty stuff differently, but in the end learned a lot from this project.
